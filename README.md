This repository contains scripts and files used to help determine where limitations should be set for contracts and documents in Dash Platform so that attack vectors are protected against and the platform performs optimally.

The **generate-docs-and-contracts** file is a set of scripts that generate various and sometimes complex document and contract JSON schemas that may otherwise take a long time to write manually.

Additionally, there is a set of Javascript scripts that are ready to be used with the **Dash JavaScript SDK** to submit documents and register contracts using the JSON schemas generated in generate-docs-and-contracts.

**rs-drive-explorer** contains data contract schemas that can be used with Sam's RS-Drive Explorer app.
